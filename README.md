## Overview

This is an app to help promote the White House's Code Sprint for the Summer Jobs API
It showcases how to mark up job descriptions so they can be crawled by search engines and end up indexed by the US Department
of Labor's Summer Job Bank for the Youth.
It also showcases how to consume the the Jobs Bank API and allow visitors to perform queries.

In this app we showcase how to find jobs for your Facebook friends who are in the right age group (16-24)
